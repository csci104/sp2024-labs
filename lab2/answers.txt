Problem 1:
    - Error on line 249
    - Code was allocating invaders[invaderRow][invaderRol] instead of
    invaders[invaderRow][invaderCol]
    - Changed InvaderRow index to InvaderCol to allocate correctly

Problem 2:
    - Error on line 27 
    - Next if statement was not running
    - Removed the semicolon

Problem 3:
    - Error on line 62
    - ColIdx was not being incremented, so stuck in infinite loop
    - added ++ColIdx into for loop condition

Problem 4: 
    - Error on line 218
    - Deallocation function call didn't match Allocation call
    - Changed DeallocateWarriors call to DeallocateWarriors(invaders, m, n) to match
    Allocation call

Problem 5: 
    - Error on line 113 and 117
    - Logic for determining the winners was opposite
